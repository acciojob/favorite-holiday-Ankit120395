	<h1>Manali</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		Manali is the beginning of an ancient trade route through Lahaul (H.P.) and Ladakh, over the Karakoram Pass and onto Yarkand and Hotan in the Tarim Basin of China. As per the 2011 Census of India, Manali Municipal Council had a population of 8,096, comprising 4,717 males and 3,379 females. Updated estimates suggest the town’s population is approximately 11,700 as of 2025.[4] During the summer 2025 monsoon season, heavy rainfall triggered multiple landslides in Mandi district, disrupting the Chandigarh–Manali highway near 4 Mile, Pandoh, and Thalot Tunnel. The route was blocked for up to 24 hours, stranding hundreds of vehicles and causing significant travel delays.[5] Statewide, over 400 roads were blocked; Mandi alone reported 232 blocked roads and 71 in Kullu district, including Manali-bound routes[6]. The disasters resulted in 137 deaths, with severe damage to roads, water and power infrastructure.[7] Due to the narrow Himalayan terrain and recent landslides, traffic congestion along the Chandigarh–Manali National Highway (NH‑21) has worsened significantly. Even outside disaster periods, gridlock is common during peak tourist season, leading to long delays and often only one-way traffic management on affected stretches.
